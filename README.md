## Installation
> ðŸš¨ Please make sure to add this NPM token in your `.npmrc` file:
> `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`

```bash
yarn add @mirrorworld/mirage.core
```

# Usage
Import the `Mirage` instance into your client. It expects a `connection` and `wallet` instance. You can get these by using one of the Solana Wallet Adapters your application will use to connect to a Solana RPC.

```ts
import {
  Mirage,
  NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY,
  MIRAGE_AUCTION_HOUSE_AUTHORITY
} from "@mirrorworld/mirage.core"

const connection = useConnection()

/** Make sure your wallet is initialized and connected to the browser before providing to Mirage */ 
const wallet = useWallet()

/** mirage instance */
const mirage = new Mirage({
  connection,
  wallet,
  NFTStorageAPIKey: NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY,
  auctionHouseAuthority: MIRAGE_AUCTION_HOUSE_AUTHORITY,
});
```

## NFT Actions

### List an NFT
Listing an NFT is done with the `Mirage.listToken` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#listToken) for details.
```ts
const mintAddress = "AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm"
const listingPrice = 0.5

await mirage.value.listToken(mintAddress, listingPrice)
```

### Cancelling listings
You can also cancel the listing of an NFT with the `Mirage.cancelListing` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#cancelListing) for details.
```ts
const mintAddress = "AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm"
const listingPrice = 0.5

// NOTE
// It's important that the listing price of the token
// matches the exact price for which it was listed.
// Otherwise the transaction will fail.
// In other words, you cannot buy a token without a corresponfing listing receipt.
await mirage.value.cancelListing(mintAddress, listingPrice)
```

### Buy an NFT
Buying an NFT is done with the `Mirage.buyToken` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#buyToken) for details.
```ts
const mintAddress = "AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm"
const listingPrice = 0.5

// NOTE
// It's important that the buying price of the token
// matches the exact price for which it was listed.
// Otherwise the transaction will fail.
// In other words, you cannot buy a token without a corresponfing listing receipt.
await mirage.value.buyToken(mintAddress, listingPrice)
```

### Gift an NFT
Gifting an NFT is done with the `Mirage.transferNft` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#transferNft) for details.
```ts
const mintAddress = "AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm"
const receipientAddress = "D5puQCwAbP29T4gRRfEuZ4Uai7UoFBcXgfutCJTBPAkL"

await mirage.value.transferNft(mintAddress, receipientAddress)
```
