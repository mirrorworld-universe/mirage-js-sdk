## Installation

> ðŸš¨ Please make sure to add this NPM token in your `.npmrc` file:
> `npm_XXXXXXXX` (Please contact `jonas@mirrorworld.fun` for an authToken.

```bash
yarn add @mirrorworld/mirage.core
```

# Usage

Import the `Mirage` instance into your client. It expects a `connection` and `wallet` instance. You can get these by using one of the Solana Wallet Adapters your application will use to connect to a Solana RPC.

These transactions require you to sign the transaction using your wallet. That means you need to have SOL. You can request SOL from the [SolFaucet](https://solfaucet.com/)

```ts
import {
  Mirage,
  // Required. You can replace wit your own
  NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY,
  // Required. You can replace wit your own
  MIRAGE_AUCTION_HOUSE_AUTHORITY,
} from '@mirrorworld/mirage.core';

const connection = useConnection();

/** Make sure your wallet is initialized and connected to the browser before providing to Mirage */
const wallet = useWallet();

/** mirage instance */
const mirage = new Mirage({
  connection,
  wallet,
  NFTStorageAPIKey: NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY,
  auctionHouseAuthority: MIRAGE_AUCTION_HOUSE_AUTHORITY,
});
```

## NFT Actions

### Claim an NFT

Claiming an NFT (technically just minting a new NFT) is done with the `Mirage.mintNFT` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#mintNFT) for details.

```ts
// This object should come from the back end. (For tokens to be claimed)
// It must follow the ERC-1155 standard for  NFT metadata
const metadataObject: MetadataObject = {
    name: `Mirror #${tokenId}`,
    symbol: 'MIRROR',
    collection: 'EMWv4qLVTLytXNheoWutoW1qFs6kP839GpZinK412GnS',
    description:
      'Mirrors is a collection of 11,000 unique AI Virtual Beings. Each Mirror can be upgraded and co-create narratives by talking with the collector, also offering a series of rights in the future games.\n',
    seller_fee_basis_points: 425,
    image: `https://storage.mirrorworld.fun/nft/1234.png`,
    attributes: [
      { trait_type: 'glasses', value: 'Bike Lens' },
      { trait_type: 'shoes', value: 'Fashion Sneakers, Purple' },
      { trait_type: 'pants', value: 'Beggar Pants, Green' },
      { trait_type: 'hat', value: 'None' },
      { trait_type: 'background', value: 'The Dance of Flies' },
      { trait_type: 'clothing', value: 'nabuC kraM Hoodie' },
      { trait_type: 'hair', value: 'nabuC kraM Hair' },
      { trait_type: 'bear', value: 'None' },
      { trait_type: 'skin', value: 'Blue' },
      { trait_type: 'soul', value: 'nabuC kraM' },
    ],
    external_url: '',
    properties: {
      files: [
        {
          uri: `https://storage.mirrorworld.fun/nft/1234.png`,
          type: 'unknown',
        },
      ],
      category: 'image',
      creators: [
        {
          address: "D5puQCwAbP29T4gRRfEuZ4Uai7UoFBcXgfutCJTBPAkL",
          verified: true,
          share: 95.75,
        },
      ],
    },
    animation_url: undefined,
  };
};

// Mint your new NFT
await mirage.mintNFT(metadata)
```

See this example [here](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirage-js-sdk/blob/9904a20ac6e6d1c7856bac1d252df2dec4bb1eff/examples/vue-ts/src/pages/index.vue#L158-L181)

## Trading

You can find examples of trading actions [here](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirage-js-sdk/blob/9904a20ac6e6d1c7856bac1d252df2dec4bb1eff/examples/vue-ts/src/pages/nft/%5Baddress%5D.vue#L288-L347)

### List an NFT

Listing an NFT is done with the `Mirage.listToken` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#listToken) for details.

```ts
const mintAddress = 'AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm';
const listingPrice = 0.5;

await mirage.listToken(mintAddress, listingPrice);
```

### Update listings

You can also update the listing of an NFT with the `Mirage.updateListing` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#updateListing) for details.

Note: This fails if there is no active listing, or if the values provided are incorrect. In case updating of a listing fails, please check the console to find out why the listing has failed.

```ts
const mintAddress = 'AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm';
const listingPrice = 0.5;
const newListingPrice = 0.9;

// NOTE
// It's important that the listing price of the token
// matches the exact price for which it was listed.
await mirage.listToken(mintAddress, listingPrice); // sets price to 0.5 SOL
await mirage.updateListing(mintAddress, listingPrice, newListingPrice); // changes price from 0.5 SOL to 0.9 SOL
```

### Cancelling listings

You can also cancel the listing of an NFT with the `Mirage.cancelListing` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#cancelListing) for details.

```ts
const mintAddress = 'AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm';
const listingPrice = 0.5;

// NOTE
// It's important that the listing price of the token
// matches the exact price for which it was listed.
// Otherwise the transaction will fail.
// In other words, you cannot buy a token without a corresponfing listing receipt.
await mirage.cancelListing(mintAddress, listingPrice);
```

### Buy an NFT

Buying an NFT is done with the `Mirage.buyToken` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#buyToken) for details.

```ts
const mintAddress = 'AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm';
const listingPrice = 0.5;

// NOTE
// It's important that the buying price of the token
// matches the exact price for which it was listed.
// Otherwise the transaction will fail.
// In other words, you cannot buy a token without a corresponfing listing receipt.
await mirage.buyToken(mintAddress, listingPrice);
```

### Gift an NFT

Gifting an NFT is done with the `Mirage.transferNft` method. See [docs](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/core_src.Mirage.html#transferNft) for details.

```ts
const mintAddress = 'AQYAGzygMZQid99up64zFG75zwRX7DE1i2v9W4teq2xm';
const receipientAddress = 'D5puQCwAbP29T4gRRfEuZ4Uai7UoFBcXgfutCJTBPAkL';

await mirage.transferNft(mintAddress, receipientAddress);
```

## Querying NFT Transaction History

Any client can query the transaction history of NFT by invoking the `Mirage.getTokenTransactions` method. This returns an array of transaction receipts typed as [`Promise<TransactionReceipt[]>`](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/interfaces/core_src.TransactionReceipt.html).

A transaction receipt contains the information used to determine the state of any given trade in which the token was involved. You can therefore use this to track the history of an NFT.

This method sorts all receipts by the date they were ([`TransactionReceipt.createdAt`](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/interfaces/core_src.TransactionReceipt.html#createdAt)), and then by their receipt type ([`TransactionReceipt.receipt_type`](https://mirage-js-sdk.vercel.app/interfaces/core_src.TransactionReceipt.html#receipt_type)).

```ts
const transactions = await mirage.getTokenTransactions(tokenAddress.value);
```

In case you want to track this information yourself, you can view the source code for the [`getTokenTransactions`](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirage-js-sdk/blob/9904a20ac6e6d1c7856bac1d252df2dec4bb1eff/packages/core/src/mirage.ts#L743-L797) method.

- [Metaplex Auction House](https://docs.metaplex.com/auction-house/definition)

### TODO:

Track token ownership and cancel any existing listings in case the owner of an NFT transfers their token while they had a prior listing.

Specifically Mirage's syncer should currently store:

Trade Stade Account Keys

1. Trade State Token Size and Price parts of the seed
2. Token Account Keys that are stored in the trade state
3. Auction House Receipts (Listing Receipts, Bid Receipts, and Purchase Receipts)

Specifically Mirage need to track these two events on Token Accounts:

1. Ownership has changed from the original Seller of the NFT
2. Token Account Amount has changed to 0

If these events happen the `MIRAGE_AUCTION_HOUSE_AUTHORITY` can call instructions to cancel the bids and listings without the seller or buyer needing to be present.
